The mouse itself performs okay and feels decent, but the mouse is so uncomfortable for me to use. The mouse forces me into a claw grip and my pinky is forced into resting at an awkward angle that puts pressure on it. For the price, it's hard to complain, but I would suggest looking at more ergonomically shaped mice.", "summary": "it doesn't feel comfortable at all like other reviewers have said", "unixReviewTime": 1460419200}
